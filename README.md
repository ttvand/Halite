# Halite IV!
This repo contains the code for my submission to the [2020 Halite Kaggle simulations competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite).
There is a separate folder for rule based and Deep Learning agents. All source code is contained in the Logic folder.

Please have a look at the [Kaggle forum for a discussion of the rule based strategy](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/discussion/183543).
